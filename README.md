And the Node based example
![alt text](https://github.com/SentientDragon5/TurnBasedStrategyBase/blob/main/NodeDemo.png?raw=true)
The node based system uses all the same scripts and the scripts for the nodes inherit from the grid locations.
The grid does not have to be square or rectangle, it can be jagged.
The movement and attack formulas are totally reprogrammable easily.
